              The Centre for Sexualities, AIDS &amp; Gender at the University of Pretoria works with learners in
              secondary schools to promote comprehensive sexualities education (CSE), reduce gender-based violence and
              sexual harassment, challenge stigma and discrimination, and advance social justice education.
            </p>

            <p>
              South Africa&apos;s Department of Education has committed to providing CSE in schools, however the
              curriculum faces strong resistance. This project works with teachers and learners from six township
              schools around Pretoria, establishing social justice hubs to promote CSE and reduce stigma and
              discrimination related to gender and sexualities.

                Asset-mapping exercises to identify what resources are currently dedicated to CSE in schools and what
                is needed, based on the direct insights and experiences of learners and teachers.

              <li>
                Using the results of this exercise to co-create educational materials with learners and teachers that
                address gaps in knowledge around CSE and social justice.

              <li>
                Convening health and wellness days in each of the six schools to advance CSE and empower learners and
