            <p>
              Young people in South Africa are regularly infantilised, subjected to abuses of adult power and
              hypocrisy, and have had their needs and desires neglected. Unemployment, unequal access to education,
              mixed messages about sexuality and gender, and challenges between tradition and modernity are among the
              major issues they face.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many young people also experience indignities in health spaces and unsafe environments in schools,
              particularly those who are sexually and gender diverse. Schools are often spaces of harm, humiliation,
              and exclusion for queer youth.

              South Africa continues to struggle to provide open, honest, and judgement-free information about sex and
              sexualities. The extent to which schools have produced critical thinkers remains debated, despite
              growing political awareness among young people.
            </p>
            <p>
              In relation to HIV, young people—particularly young women—have been neglected in prevention and
              treatment programmes, despite higher prevalence rates.

            <h2>Youth Engagement and Activism</h2>
            <p>
              Many initiatives draw on the optimism and desire of young people to engage in social change and
              activism. These initiatives recognise the need to move beyond individual empowerment and address social
              and structural barriers.

            <p>
              The Centre for Sexualities, AIDS and Gender (CSA&amp;G) has a longstanding commitment to working with
              young people, particularly within the context of sexuality, gender, and HIV.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSA&amp;G engages young people in ways that encourage critical reflection on identity, culture,
              citizenship, leadership, power, and accountability. These insights inform community outreach and social
              justice initiatives.

              Through its vision of <em>“understanding power, exploring diversity, and enabling inclusivity”</em>,
              CSA&amp;G seeks to contribute to a South Africa where social justice is realised and every person can
