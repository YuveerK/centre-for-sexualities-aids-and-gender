        <div className="mt-10 space-y-6 text-ink-700">
          <p>
            When the CSA&G opened in 1999, as the Centre for the Study of AIDS (CSA), Nelson Mandela’s presidency was
            coming to a close, the AIDS epidemic was peaking, life-saving antiretroviral medications were available to
            very few South Africans, and the responses of tertiary education institutions were largely biomedical and
            narrow in focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CSA stepped into this space at the University of Pretoria (UP) to offer a unique holistic programme,
            including volunteer, education and counselling services for students; inter-faculty engagement on HIV
            research and curriculum integration; community engagement initiatives and, through research, the
            development of new social theory to understand the drivers and outcomes of AIDS more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>The Centre’s staff has expanded and contracted over the years, in line with shifting priorities.</p>

          </ul>
          <p className="mt-5 text-ink-700">
            In light of these imperatives, and building on its expertise and presence at UP, the CSA renamed itself the
            Centre for Sexualities, AIDS and Gender (CSA&G) with the vision of “understanding power, exploring
            diversity and enabling inclusivity”.
