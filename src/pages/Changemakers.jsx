            (DFI) has introduced and launched a capacity building programme working towards the professional
            certification of gender equality changemakers in Africa.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Gender Equality Changemakers Programme has been established in partnership and consultation with two
            leading international universities: the Centre for Sexualities, AIDS and Gender at the University of
            Pretoria, and{' '}

          <div className="changemakers-purpose">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
              The programme was developed in response to the global demand for gender equality change agents to address
              gender inequality and discrimination in organisations.
            </p>
            <p>
              This community-building online-learning programme engages a global network of highly skilled and
              gender-conscious changemakers who will accelerate progress toward gender equity through policies,
              gender-inclusive initiatives, products, and services.

            <h2>Curriculum</h2>
            <p>
              Through a carefully curated and localised curriculum—including interactive faculty-led live sessions and
              multimedia assessments—changemakers are equipped to enact profound and lasting change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The curriculum offers a deeply engaging, highly personal, and immediately applicable learning experience
              in the African context.

          <div className="changemakers-courses">
            <h2>Programme Structure</h2>
            <p>
              The programme aims for an inclusive student body and consists of six courses aimed at two distinct
              audiences:
            </p>

            <h3>Standalone Course (Senior-Level Leaders)</h3>
            <p>
              One standalone course is targeted at senior-level leaders (directors, executives, partners, presidents,
              or equivalent). The <strong>Leading Equitable Organisations</strong> course guides participants through
              personal reflection and authentic dialogue among peers on gender issues and leadership practice, helping
              them uncover how they can foster more equitable organisations.
            </p>

            <h3>Five Interrelated Courses (Managers &amp; Professionals)</h3>
            <p>Five interrelated courses are targeted at mid- or senior-level managers and professionals.</p>

            <p>
              The first two courses—<strong>Foundations for Gender Equity</strong> and{' '}
              <strong>Organisations and Gender</strong>—guide participants through personal reflection and authentic
              dialogue on gender and the gendered nature of organisations, helping them discover their role in bringing
              about change.
            </p>

            <p>
              The next two courses—<strong>Frameworks for Gender and Organisational Change</strong> and{' '}
              <strong>Practical Skills for Leading Gender Transformative Change</strong>—provide an applied
              specialisation in leading gender-equitable change projects within organisations. Participants complete
              hands-on assignments that culminate in the final <strong>Capstone</strong> course.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the Capstone course, participants draft a cohesive action plan that they will initiate within their
              own organisations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gender Equality Changemakers must complete all five interrelated courses to earn a certification and
              become certified Gender Changemakers.
