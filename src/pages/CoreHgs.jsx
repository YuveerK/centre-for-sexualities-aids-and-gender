            Africa-Europe Cluster of Research Excellence in Health, Gender and Sexualities
          </h1>

          <p>
            The Africa-Europe Cluster of Research Excellence in Health, Gender, and Sexualities (CoRE HGS) generates
            ground-breaking interdisciplinary research to address health disparities among gender and sexual minority
            populations. It integrates public health and social sciences to understand the complex interplay of social,
            cultural, and healthcare-related factors affecting health outcomes and access to care.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cluster was officially established in July 2023 as part of a joint initiative by the African Research
            Universities Alliance (ARUA) and The Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities (the Guild). It is
            recognised for its academic excellence and commitment to equitable collaborative research and researcher
            training.

            <h2>Vision and Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
              Over the next decade, the Africa-Europe CoRE HGS envisions conducting innovative research, developing
              interdisciplinary training, fostering international collaboration, and influencing evidence-based
              policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Planned milestones include initiating collaborative research projects, establishing a master&apos;s
              programme, facilitating capacity-building through a doctoral research school, and organising
              international research conferences.
