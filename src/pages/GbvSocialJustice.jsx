            This project aims to strengthen the practice of partners of the Embassy of Ireland in Pretoria (South Africa
            and Zimbabwe) by establishing a collaborative relationship between partners and the Centre for Sexualities,
            AIDS and Gender (CSA&amp;G).
          </p>

          <p>
            The project responds to the need for partners to reflect on, adapt, and strengthen their practices, while
            exploring different ways of approaching and using evidence.
          </p>

            <h2>Project Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
              The project seeks to strengthen partners&apos; practices related to gender equality and social justice
              through the following outputs:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Increased critical engagement with multiple forms of evidence</li>
              <li>Strengthened collaboration between partners</li>
              <li>Improved understanding of GBV and gender equality trends</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div className="gbv-structure">
            <h2>Programme Structure</h2>
            <p>
              The engagement spans five years, supported by ongoing platforms and interventions that enable partners to
              work more effectively, critically, and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              The collaboration uses three interlinked components: reflective partner forums, an online repository, and
              an evidence-based strand that blends theory and practice.
            </p>
