  "contentText": "The Centre for Sexualities, AIDS and Gender invites you to a webinar series on the US political crisis and its impact on minorities and, specifically, trans and gender-diverse people. This 3-part webinar series will explore recent developments in the US and how they affect queer, trans and gender-diverse (South) Africans. In the first webinar, Darkening Skies: What’s Happened to the USA?, we explore the rise of Trumpism and the MAGA movement, the origins of Project 2025, and how the Project 2025 blueprint serves as a roadmap for a vision of the US which promotes ultra-conservative ideals, anti-gender ideology, anti-DEI philosophies, White supremacy, colonialism, and cisheteropatriarchy. The second webinar, Shadow Boxing: How US Ideologies Impact (South) African Queer and Trans Realities, explores the impact of these US developments on (South) Africa, how the ‘anti-gender movement’ has found resonance in (South) Africa, and how local programmes, specifically those affecting the queer community, have been affected. In Lighting the Way: (South) African Paths to Queer and Trans Solidarity and Resistance, we conclude the webinar series by focusing on strategies for mobilisation, resistance, and organisation, as well as reimagining work that is not as reliant on US funding. Dates: 7 April 2025, 23 April 2025 & 7 May 2025 Time: 16:00 – 17:30 SAST Venue: Zoom RSVP: Please register for each session you wish to attend here: 7 April 2025 23 April 2025 7 May 2025",
