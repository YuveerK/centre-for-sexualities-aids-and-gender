On the other hand, this text asks questions which most authors have shied away from asking.

Through a discursive analysis of the 2018 presidential campaigns, <em>Gendered and Sexual Imagi(nations) </em>draws attention to the misogynism that characterised both Chamisa’s and Mnangagwa’s performances.

The ways in which we imagine possible futures are crucial for those of us who work within the space of social and gender justice. <em>Gendered and Sexual Imagi(nations) </em>reminds us, however, that we need to do more than imagine futures in which the men at the top change while the fabric of society remains the same. Instead, it asks us to imagine a society that appears, thinks, and acts in radically different ways to the ones that we know. We need to ask whether and how we can imagine a society in which women are not relegated to the domestic sphere, and where women who challenge the status quo are not labelled immoral, irresponsible and irrational. However, this would require dismantling of the patriarchal ideologies that prevail as yet another generation of young men flex their muscles, calling for the strongest rooster to step forward.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.justgender.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mawere-Monograph-e-book.pdf\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1250 lazy\" src=\"https://www.csagup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mawere-1.0-183x300.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.csagup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mawere-1.0-183x300.jpg\" alt=\"Mawere cover\" width=\"183\" height=\"300\" data-srcset=\"https://www.csagup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mawere-1.0-183x300.jpg 183w, https://www.csagup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mawere-1.0-627x1030.jpg 627w, https://www.csagup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mawere-1.0-429x705.jpg 429w, https://www.csagup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mawere-1.0.jpg 671w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\"></a></p>\n</body></html>",
